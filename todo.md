thing that I want to support:
enable randoms in a response 
    (ENUMS, timestamp, positions, string, int, double)
add custom routes for 
4. "save" the current randroms so the ID's won't change
5. add changes by positions in tree
check if collection exists before returning
check how we do our time and maybe add support for timezone
path for inserting the recieved data again to the DB
